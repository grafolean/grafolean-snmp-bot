    environment:
      # Backend url must be set to the address of the Grafolean backend, for example this uses Grafolean hosted service:
      # - BACKEND_URL=https://grafolean.com/api
      - BACKEND_URL=${BACKEND_URL}
      # To use SNMP Collector, a bot with the protocol "snmp" must be added via user interface, then the token needs to be copied here:
      - BOT_TOKEN=${BOT_TOKEN}
      # Interval between fetching information about jobs:
      - JOBS_REFRESH_INTERVAL=${JOBS_REFRESH_INTERVAL}
    restart: always
    # Grafolean backend must be accessible on BACKEND_URL *from the point of view of container*. If running
    # on the same host, '127.0.0.1' translates to container, not host - this directive changes network mode
    # so that Docker networking is bypassed.
